title: Week 1: Intro to Python and Javascript
---

The first week in Software Engineering was definitely a unique experience. The style of asking students questions during class directly took me by surprise as I was the first one to answer questions. The questions were not too difficult that they would be too hard to answer, but at the same time they definitely ensured that I would be pressured to pay attention.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/jadesym/jadesym.github.io) on GitHub.

### Tip of the Week

For anyone looking for Software Engineering jobs, I would highly suggest taking Competitive Programming CS109. It is extremely useful in understanding/implementing algorithmic problems, especially the ones that top companies may give you during interviews.
