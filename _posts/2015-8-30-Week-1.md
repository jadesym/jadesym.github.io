title: Week 1: Intro to Python and Javascript [8/30/15]
---

The first week in Software Engineering was definitely a unique experience. The style of asking students questions during class directly took me by surprise as I was the first one to answer questions. The questions were not too difficult that they would be too hard to answer, but at the same time they definitely ensured that I would be pressured to pay attention. 

### Tip of the Week

For anyone looking for Software Engineering jobs, I would highly suggest taking Competitive Programming CS109. It is extremely useful in understanding/implementing algorithmic problems, especially the ones that top companies may give you during interviews.
